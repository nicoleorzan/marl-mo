### TL;DR (paper, in a few lines)

- We introduce MO-EPGG, a **multi-objective** version of the Extended Public Goods Game that separates **individual vs collective payoffs**.
- Each agent uses a non-linear utility (risk preference) over the payoff vector, and we study how this interacts with incentive-alignment uncertainty. 
- With MORL we show regimes where preferences + uncertainty promote or suppress cooperation even in mixed-motive settings. 

### Example Install

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

To launch a trial run, in `src/experiments/` give the comman:

```
python3 caller.py
```
This defaults to running a 2-agents 2-objectives MO-EPGG, with MO-deep-Q Learning for each agent and linear scalarization function. Other default parameters can be found in the file.

For a custom run, you can give:

```
python3 caller.py --n_agents 4 
```
